<h1>Exploring Colorado Wine Country in Paonia, Grand Junction and Aspen</h1>
<p>Paonia, Colorado is nestled in the secluded North Fork Valley &ndash; between Aspen and Grand Junction as the crow
  flies. It is a unique climate where Colorado&rsquo;s incredible Rocky Mountains merge dramatically with the
  mesas and flats of Utah.</p>
<p>In the last year, the world has started to catch on to Colorado&rsquo;s best kept secret: the North Fork
  Valley is host to a secluded natural beauty, a temperate climate and geology that supports fine Colorado wine
  making, and a presence of creative, individualistic personalities to preside over it all.</p>
<p>The North Fork today reminds some of the Willamette Valley in Oregon twenty years ago &ndash; an epicenter of
  great wine, burgeoning food and wonderful people.</p>
<p>While the North Fork can&rsquo;t approach Willamette Valley&rsquo;s size, it does embrace a unique set of
  environmental and cultural circumstances that make it one of the best places to eat, drink and be merry in the
  state &ndash; all with a real, down to earth country flavor that no longer exists in many of America&rsquo;s
  fine wine regions. As Colorado wine moves rapidly into the top five wine producing states for quality, the
  North Fork is leading the way,</p>
