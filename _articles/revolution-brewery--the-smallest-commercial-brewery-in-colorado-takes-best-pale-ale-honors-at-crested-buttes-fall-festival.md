Crested Butte, CO-September 2009. Revolution Brewery of Paonia has been awarded the "Best Pale Ale" award at the Fall Festival of Beers and Chili Cook Off in Crested Butte.

The brewery won with its India Pale Ale style beer, called SEIPA, beating top competitors Great Divide Brewing Co, New Belgium Brewing Co, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co, and Stone Brewing, among others.

"We really have enjoyed the support of the [North Fork] valley and Paonia," co-owner and brewmeister Mike King said. "And we really appreciate it."

The honors at Crested Butte arrive as the brewery expands its operations, adding two new 4bbl fermenters to its production line. Distribution agreements are also in the works to bring Revolution's beers to Gunnison, Crested Butte, Vail and other West Slope venues.

The start-up brewery, located in Paonia, CO, is the only micro-brewery in Delta County. "We started a brewery because we love to brew," said co-owner Gretchen King.

Revolution Brewery produces up to six beers at any given time, ranging from Amber-style ales to IPA's and Stouts. For more information, visit [http://revolution-brewing.com/](http://revolution-brewing.com/) or contact Gretchen King at 970-314-4938.
