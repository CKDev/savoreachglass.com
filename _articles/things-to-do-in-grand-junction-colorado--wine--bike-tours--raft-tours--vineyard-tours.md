<p>The largest city on the Western Slope, Grand Junction has in years past been known for its municipality. Yes, it even has an airport. In recent years, however, it has become a city known less as a Western hub - and less as a city to drive through on road trips. It has instead become better known for its ability to stand tall on its own. Rather than a thoroughfare, it is now a destination. With scenic views, new wineries, and endless things to do, it's safe to say that Grand Junction has indeed earned its "Grand" title.</p>
