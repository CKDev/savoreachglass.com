For some time now, it has been the mission of savoreachglass.com to bridge the gap between the wonder of wine and the enjoyment of life. Wearing many hats on our head - and the occasional lap shade - we have aimed to remove the stigmatism that can sometimes be found with wine, ruining the drinking experience quicker than cork taint.

We've stood on top of our wine boxes and preached to the masses. We've told everyone that wine should be fun, it should be savored, and it should never be taken as seriously as some people believe. We've chastised the 100 point rating scale. We've brought wine down to a non-threatening, even humorous, level. We've drank wine during business hours; we've accidentally spilled wine on our marketing proposals. We've put a cork in the haughtiness that certain wine lovers perpetuate. And, naturally, we've rescued grapes from burning buildings.

We've done this all with one hope: our wine ideology would travel through the grapevine like wildfire.

Turns out, we aren't the only ones trying to make this difference.

Tom Geniesse, owner of Bottlerocket Wine and Spirit in New York City, possessed a similar notion when he designed a new kind of wine shop. Containing an inventory of 365 wines - one for each day of the year - Geniesse made a reputation for himself by making a wine store something they have never really been before: user friendly.

Geniesse, it seems, knows the confusion that seeps into the mind of everyone who enters a liquor store or winery. The aisles, filled with vintages, are intimidating and, even those who know wine, don't always know where to go. With so many bottles surrounding you, it's easy to get intimidated, to panic and leave or - what's worse - purchase a bottle of Boone's Farm. Geniesse, to the rescue, is making sure no wine lovers buy the farm.

At Bottlerocket Wine and Spirit the true spirit of spirits is restored: fun begins to ferment and shopping for wine doesn't leave you wanting to drink yourself into oblivion.

This store has something that wine lovers of all walks and all levels can find useful and appealing. For those of you who are particular about the nationality of your wine, bottles are lined up by country, allowing you easy access to your preferred region. For those of you whose wine preference is not dictated by nation, wines are organized thematically. From wines with "food themes" (such as which wines to eat with fish or steak) to wines that make great gifts for your boss, this store aims to take confusion out of the mind of the patron, leaving you less likely to want to whine about wine shopping.

Bottlerocket Wine and Spirit goes above and beyond typical wine stores. It's welcoming, it's innovative, and it's highly creative. Take, for instance, their takeout section. An oversized Chinese food container marks the display of wines that go well with local restaurants (menus from the local restaurants are also available). This allows you to get the ideal wine for your take out, taking out the hassle of matching wine with dinner.

The back for the store offers you a chance to read and learn about wine with a large variety of wine and cookbooks for purchase or viewing. You can browse, memorize, or simply turn the pages and drool. Each bottle, accompanied by an information card, gives you this same option, as it offers you knowledge of the purchased product. The store also includes a children's nook and water and biscuits for customers who bring their dogs.

Emphasizing celebration over intimidation, Bottlerocket Wine and Spirit offers a truly unique experience, helping you to find a bottle you love in an easygoing, lighthearted manner.

Free your wine, and the rest will follow.
