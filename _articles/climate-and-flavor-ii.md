The editors of _SavorEachGlass.com_ were recently presented a white wine for a blind tasting.

On observing the _color_, we noted that it was a deeper yellow, flirting with golden, with the slightest hint of green. Hints of green immediately indicate a _cooler climate_ wine, with vegetle tones or perhaps apple/pear flavors within. A quick swirl revealed quite a body, suggesting the obvious culprit: the Chardonnay grape.

A quick sniff hit us like a train as a bold peach flavor presented itself, followed by hints of green things (asparagus?). Right away, the above flavor chart suggests a moderate climate wine, confirmed by both the peach flavor and the green undertones. The taste confirmed this, presenting bold peachiness and with a well-rounded tangy acidity another hallmark of cool to moderate climate white wines.

The boldness of the peach in the scent and the flavor suggested right away a new world wine. However, the tangy acidity and flavor of peach suggested that, despite a new world straight-forwardness, the wine was from a cooler climate. That means either a vineyard on the coast or of altitude. Our initial observations pointed toward a Chardonnay either from a coastal region or highland region of Australia or South America. Indeed, the mystery wine was determined to be from a well-known vineyard on the coast of Argentina.

## Digging Deeper: Flavor and Climate II

Our exploration so far yielded two key principles: the first, observed through our analysis of the old world vs **the new world**, tells us that a wine that is bolder is more likely to be from the new world (i.e. South America, United States, Australia), whereas a wine that is more _subtle and earthy_ is more likely to be from the old world (i.e. France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Eastern Europe).

Our second observation discussed in **climate and flavor I** detailed that through simply noting a wine\'s body and acidity, we could determine if it was from a warmer climate or a cooler climate.

Observing _Body_ and _Acidity_ drastically narrows our playing field when attempting to identify a wine's region of origin. But now, we can take it a bit further by using climate to hone in on a wine's specific flavors and scents.
