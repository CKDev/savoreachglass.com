			<h1>Personal Sommelier Service</h1>			
			
<p>The two things that can be the most fun about drinking wine can also be the most intimidating: 1) <strong>learning</strong> about what you are drinking and 2) <strong>arranging special events</strong> such as parties, weddings or corporate events where there will be a wide diversity of palettes and preferences.</p>
<p>Savor Each Glass offers three services to help you achieve your goals in a spirit of relaxed learning and fun:</p>
<h2>Hire a Sommelier for a Special Event</h2>

<h2>Hire a Sommelier for Individual Tutoring</h2>
<p>Some people hire a tutor to learn a new language â€“ why not hire a Sommelier to learn the language and intricacies of wine?</p>

    <li>How to properly serve wine of various types</li>
    <li>How to blind-taste</li>
    <li>How to find the best deals</li>
    <li>How to properly stock your cellar</li>

    <li>And much more!</li>
