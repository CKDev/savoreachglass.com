In this column, we want to share with all, regardless of age, our experiences, good and bad, as we try to bridge the many gaps we have encountered in our endeavors to go from wine ignorance to wine enlightenment. Twenty-somethings and sixty-somethings on up, may also have trouble doing this. Both groups often have a limited budget and may be early on the wine scene in the one case, or late, as retirement occurs and they discover they like wine and know little about it. The gaps we plan to discuss include the mystiques of wine making, wine touring, wine tasting, and wine costs. We begin with wine tasting, which sounds simple enough unless you have just missed five out of seven wines, like we did at a recent wine tasting. Embarrassing! We have learned that a good sommelier (wine expert) is critical for a successful beginning wine taster, to help guide you through the hundreds of adjectives describing aspects of wines, such as appearance, nose, and taste.

One of the easier distinctions to make in tasting wine, is that between Old World wines, from Europe, and New World offerings (the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa). The Old World wines, very briefly, tend to be richer, stronger, with leathery and oak hints. The New World has many of the same grapes, but the offerings are perhaps crisper and more fruit-forward. Any more, it may be hard to tell if a wine is Old or New, but it's fun to try, and we recommend that you keep note cards or a notebook as you try out different wines, and record the color, the taste, what you think it might go well with, and the price, so you can remember and add to this data as you learn more.

At one recent blind tasting, we had trouble distinguishing between an excellent twenty dollar bottle of wine versus a ten dollar bottle of wine. This leads us to believe that there are many delicious wines in the ten dollar and below price range, that are perfectly acceptable wines. Future columns will address the benefits of tastings, both to try out wines and to see how much we've learned, but in this first effort, we have three good, inexpensive wines to recommend.

In a wine discussion, it is usually best to start with a white, and the New Zealand New Haven, 2006 Sauvignon Blanc, is a very nice wine, with a pale, clear color; a strong citric nose (odor, to the newbees), and a value price to go with its pure dry self. This wine, at about \$12.00 a bottle, would work well with appetizers, for cocktails, and for seafood or pasta dishes.

Next, from Spain, we loved a Roman de Bilbao 2003 Tempranillo, priced around \$10.00, and giving that Old World contrast with its clear, bright but deep red color, and an earthy, slightly leathery, black cherry/strawberry nose. This would be good for cocktails, perhaps with some kind of meat appetizer, as well as making a pairing with a nice prime rib.

Finally, another Old World wine, Franceâ€™s Tortoise Creek Merlot, 2003. This has a darker color, a richer nose, almost like a Cabernet, and a really wonderful price of under \$8 a bottle, so you can splurge on a fine steak and have a terrific dinner
