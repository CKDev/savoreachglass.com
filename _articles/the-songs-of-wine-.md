When it comes to wine, we use a variety of our senses. Our sense of taste and our sense of smell helps us perceive flavors and aromas, our sense of sight helps us look for legs, helping us to identify body, and our sense of touch, well, that just helps us to make sure we grab a glass of wine, and not a can of beer. In fact, there is only one sense we don't really use: our sense of hearing.

Now, I've done it myself: I've had a few too many glasses of wine, put the glass up to my ear, and sworn up and down that I could hear the ocean. Except for those rare, okay frequent, instances, hearing, when it comes to wine, is a bit left out. That is, however, until it "auditions" for inclusion in the form of song.

The following is our list of some of the best wine songs to ever grape, er grace, us with their presence.

**Alcohol (Brad Paisley)**: So, this song might not be just about wine. With lyrics that talk about all kinds of alcohol, the spotlight isn't on a bottle of Shiraz doing a rather long, but oddly touching, interpretive dance. Still, any song that gives a shout out to Bordeaux, France is a must listen for the wine lover. Not too bad, Brad.

**The Wino and I know (Jimmy Buffett)**: One of the best singers to listen to at any kind of party, Jimmy Buffett delivers a song that acknowledges the wine drinker in all of us. There is, however, one problem: the line "the wino and I," for many of us, is redundant.

**Red Red Wine (UB40)**: A song that has made many of us feel so fine, "Red Red Wine" is just a fun fun time. We might not know what the heck "Monkey pack him rizla pon the sweet dep line" means, but who cares: let's just focus on memorizing the rest of the song's rap section.

**Bottle of Wine (Tom Paxton)**: An oldie, but a goodie, "Bottle of Wine" pays homage to the fruit of the vine. But, when Tom sings the "When you gonna let me get sober?" line, we can't help but think he's joking. Seriously Paxton, pour another drink.

**Strawberry Wine (Deana Carter)**: Even though we are pretty sure the "Strawberry Wine" in this song is likely Boone's Farm, it's still a good tune. It talks about first loves, summer nights, and remembering when 30 was old. As someone who turns 30 in a few months, allow me to state that 30 is the new 20, oh wait, the new 21.

**Little Ole Wine Drinker Me (Dean Martin)**: We can only expect a great song from the man who was once quoted as saying, "You haven't drunk too much wine if you can still lie on the floor without holding on." Very true Dean, very true.

**Champagne Supernova (Oasis)**: I know that I may be one of the few people who actually love Oasis (call me Liam!), but this is a great song. Hopefully we will all someday find ourselves in a "Champagne Supernova," or at least like a Champagne brunch.

**Blood Red Wine (Rolling Stones)**: Wine's greatest chance of ever truly rocking out, this song allows us to picture a Merlot with a Mohawk, a Pinot with a pierced nose, and a Traminer with a tattoo.

**Two More Bottles of Wine (Martina McBride)**: A tune that teaches us that our lovers can move out and, as long as there is wine, everything will be okay, "Two More Bottles of Wine" would have been just a little bit better if it had replaced the word "bottles" with the word "cases."

**Wine, Women an' Song (White Snake)**: As a female, I might not identify with this song as much as the male gender. After all, it talks zealously about landing a good woman. But, who cares: I can turn lesbian for one article and chalk it up to experimentation.
