For whatever reason, wine has become a drink that some people fear. Some people are simply too scared to approach it, looking at a bottle the same way they used to look at the popular girl or boy they had a crush on in high school. No one is really sure when wine got this reputation, but it did: wine is the most intimidating of alcohol. 

Yet, this notion seems absurd: should wine really be that scary? It is, after all, just a drink; people should be able to outwit even the most cunning of vintages simply by knocking over the bottle and watching the contents spill out over the floor. Wine should be more scared of us than we are of it. 

But, it's not the wine's fault we are scared. Instead, it's the fault of the people who take wine so seriously, looking down on others who don't agree with their "impeccable" taste or laughing to themselves whenever someone butchers the words "Pinot Noir" while ordering at a restaurant. It is these people who are to blame: they stomped on grapes until the fun oozed out. 

In defiance to these types of wine drinkers - the ones who always make sure they hold their wine glass with their pinky at an exact 90 degree angle - the following is a list of wine terms that are explained without pomp. If you look carefully enough, you might even find something fun.
