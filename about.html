  >I'd like to give you a little background on who I am and what I do.<br />
  <br />
  My name is Tynan Szvetecz, and I am a <strong>wine nerd</strong>. I am an
  <em>Executive Wine Sommelier</em> and
  <em>Senior Wine Instructor</em> certified through the
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.internationalwineguild.com"
    >International Wine Guild</a
  >, one of the few state-accredited
  <a href="http://www.internationalwineguild.com" target="_blank"
    >wine schools</a
  >
  in the United States. I'm also a Candidate for <em>Master Sommelier</em>,
  which is a fancy way of saying I passed a five wine double-blind tasting.*<br />
  <br />
  <em class="small"
    >*This is one of the psychotic practices in the wine world where fancy
    looking, intimidating people ask you to identify a wine's grape, country of
    origin, region within that country, and vintage within 2 years based on only
    what you smell, see and taste in the glass. It's an intellectual chess match
    where one wrong assumption can run you completely off course. It involves
    things like panic, sweating, self-esteem crisis management and other fun
    character building activities. </em

  <br />
  Presently I live on Colorado's Western Slope, in <strong>Paonia</strong>,
  where I teach public and professional wine classes and help the local wine
  makers improve their outreach. I also am the managing partner in an internet
  marketing company called
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.commercekitchen.com">Commerce Kitchen</a>
  that focuses on outreach for the Wine Industry all over the country, using
  Community Management and Social Networking tools.
