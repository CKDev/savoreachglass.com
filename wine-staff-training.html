<h1>Wine Staff Training</h1>

<p>Customers are becoming savvy to the ways of proper wine service, and managers that don’t keep their staff properly
    trained risk having their restaurants viewed as sloppy or even unprofessional.</p>
<p>Staff properly trained for proper wine service achieves important key goals for any restaurant :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Customers are more likely to trust your expertise with preparing food</li>
    <li>It makes an evening “special”, and one customers are more likely to tell their friends and acquaintances about
    </li>
    <li>It helps prevent problems that can arise from staff not understanding what to do about corked or oxidized wine
    </li>
    <li>It reinforces your establishment as offering a complete experience</li>
</ul>
