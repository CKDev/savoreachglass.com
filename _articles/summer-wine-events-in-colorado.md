<p><img class="border top left" src="/images/galleries/d41d8cd98f00b20/913018851880_medium.jpg" alt="">Since the conception of the three month break, summertime has always belonged to children: no more school, no more books, no more teachers, dirty looks (and all that jazz). It is summer, after all, that offers swimming pools, ice cream trucks, and bicycle races. But, for those of us who have outgrown the slip&nbsp; n&nbsp; slide, summer - or rather the enjoyment of - doesn t need to be a thing of the past. Thanks to Colorado wine events, summer is now a 21 and over event. <br>

Colorado wine events have opened up doors in the Rocky Mountains: this state is no longer one consumed with winter. It will no longer sit by idly waxing its skis and counting the moments till the first snowflake emerges. Instead, it will pull out a glass, pop off a cork, and engage its senses.<br>
<br>
There are several Colorado wine events to enjoy over the next few months. The following is just a tasting:<br>
