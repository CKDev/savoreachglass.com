<p>Tynan Szvetecz made a wine presentation to the Culinary School of the Rockies as they prepared duck three ways and a
  cornucopia of fresh sides. The Boulder-based school was in the midst of a several-week intensive in the North Fork
  Valley learning how to raise, prepare and harvest local, organic foods and prepare them with gusto. Master Chef Yvon
  Gros helped educate the students.</p>
