<p>When we think of wine, we often think of Napa Valley, the vineyards of Italy, perhaps even certain regions of Chile. Most of us, however, don't think of Colorado. A state that is well known for beer, Colorado is one place where wine can easily be overlooked.</p>
<p>However, unbeknownst to many, Colorado isn't merely a place for a brewery or two (hundred), it is also a place for many a vineyard. That's right, butt out Bud, and cool it Coors, it's time for Colorado wine to shine.</p>
<p>There is really no place in Colorado better suited for wine production than the Western Slope, specifically the city of Grand Junction. <a href="/grand-junction-wine">Wine in Grand Junction</a> might not have the prestige of, say, wine from Spain (or the accent), but it certainly has its own uniqueness to offer the wine industry.</p>
<p>Grand Junction is known as <a href="/colorado-wine">Colorado's wine country</a>, a label that is well deserved. A little bit desert, a little bit mountain, a little bit country and, heck let's say it, a little bit rock â€˜n roll, the outskirts of Grand Junction are nothing short of beautiful tapestries of vineyard after vineyard. These vineyards, charming to say the least, produce high quality wine that is sure to give each drinker their own Rocky Mountain High.</p>
<p>Now, before we continue talking about wine in Grand Junction, let's digress a moment and talk about wine in general. Those experienced in the world of vino know that wine is nothing to fear: rather than run from a bottle, we should merely caress it with the words, "Come to Mama."</p>
<p>Yet, for the novice, wine can be scary, as if every vineyard and every glass is filled with grapes of wrath. Because wine seems to come with certain rules - how to hold a glass, how to taste properly, which foods to match with which wines, how to swirl and smell - it can be a bit scary for the person who is just beginning. Luckily, Grand Junction is a great place to wet your palate and get started.</p>
<p><a href="/grand-junction-wine">Wine in Grand Junction</a> is not quite as intimidating as the wines from other places, such as France. While the former is easy going, the latter goes around bragging about how it was once sipped by Napoleon.  The <a href="/colorado-wine">Colorado wine industry</a> is young, new, and exciting. Rather than turning up a nose to people who don't know their palate from their pointer finger, Grand Junction embraces connoisseurs and beginners alike with one common chant: pull up a glass.</p>
<p>The <a href="/grand-junction-wine">wines in Grand Junction</a> are varied. While Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Chardonnay are dominant, Riesling, Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet Franc are also represented.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to experience wine in Grand Junction is to take a wine tour. From a tasting tour to a harvest tour, there is something on the Western Slope for every wine drinker. Come see for yourself. You, but not the wine, are sure to be spoiled.</p>
